- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FranciscoMessina
     a MERN full stack web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about coding to be able to build amazing apps.

- I currently work at a family owned used books shop, in my free time I try to code as much as possible, and currently I am building a managament system for the bookshop.

- I mainly work with the PERN stack, using Nest.js for the backend, PostgreSQL for db, and react for the frontend, but I also know a little about:
     - C#
